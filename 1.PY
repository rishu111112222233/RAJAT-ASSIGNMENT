Algorithm: Arrange Clothes in an Almirah

1. Start
2. Identify the total number of shelves (n) in the almirah.
3. Categorize all clothes into groups such as:
   - Formal wear
   - Casual wear
   - Traditional wear
   - Seasonal or rarely used clothes
4. Assign priority based on frequency of use:
   - Daily use clothes get higher priority
   - Rarely used clothes get lower priority
5. Allocate shelves as follows:
   - Middle shelves for daily use clothes (easy access)
   - Upper shelves for rarely used or seasonal clothes
   - Lower shelves for heavier items like jeans or sweaters
6. Within each shelf:
   - Fold clothes uniformly to save space
   - Arrange clothes by type and color for faster identification
7. Store accessories (belts, ties, scarves) in separate boxes or side sections.
8. Ensure no shelf is overcrowded to maintain easy retrieval.
9. End
